    <h1>BYU's Resume</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Before losing the Texas Tech in the Big 12 Conference Championship game BYU was number 6 in strength of record according to ESPN. After their loss they then dropped to number nine although it is important to note that most top 12 teams did not play in a conference championship game.</li>
        <li>Additionally we have the 23rd hardest strength of schedule, better than the likes of Indiana, Ohio State, Texas Tech, Ole Miss, Miami, and Notre Dame.</li>
        <li>If that wasn't enough we also are one of two teams to win on the road against 4 or more bowl-eligible teams</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To be fair, we did win some games close earlier in the season. But we also had a freshman quarterback who was promoted just before the season started. If you look at the trend after the Utah game with exception to Texas Tech, a top 4 team, we beat all of our teams but double digits. We could have scored even more, but Coach Kalani purposely slows it downs and eats the clock after we are ahead by a certain point so that is one reason we don't get as many style points. </p>

    <p>Here we can see the relationship between the top 12 team's strength of schedule and strength of record. The best quadrants are the bottom left quadrant, then the upper left, then the bottom right, then finally the upper right.</p>
    <p>While BYU isn't in the best quadrant, we can see that they are in the upper left with Alabama and Oklahoma. Meanwhile we see how Notre Dame and Miami, Miami of which made it into the playoffs, are clearly in the worst position compared to all of the other teams.</p>
    
    <h1>Ok, So Then Why is BYU Not In?</h1>
    <p>Well there are multiple reasons involved and to be honest we can't know why exactly since the selection committee is made up of multiple people, each with their own lines of reasoning, perspectives, and biases. However, here are a few things to consider:</p>
    <section id="ESPN-and-SEC-Bias">
    <h2>SEC Bias</h2>
    <p>While I agree that the SEC is one of if not the best college football conference, there is a strange reverance for these teams. Why is that? Like why is it BYU, Ohio State, and Virgina all dropped after losing their conference games are punished, except Alabama who is got blown out and even had negative yards?</p>
    <p>One reason is because of it's history as a great program. But it also might have a lot to do with ESPN. Here's some of the facts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
        ESPN owns the exclusive television and streaming rights to most SEC teams
        <ul>
            <li>This means they make money whenever an SEC team makes the playoffs</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>They hold the exclusive TV rights to the College Football Playoff</li>
        <li>While ESPN does not select teams, its shows heavily shape public perception around rankings, resumes, and narratives.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Notice how BYU was ignored in the discussions? ESPN would literally talk more about SEC teams BEHIND BYU.</p>
    <p>On top of that, the chair of the playoff selection committee is from the SEC and many critize his vague answers.</p>
    </section>
    <h2>Perceptions of BYU</h2>
    <p>BYU wasn't even ranked in the preseason. if BYU was ranked in the preseason, the chances of us being ranked higher is much more likely. Historically, many teams don't take BYU seriously</p>
    <p>You can even see how the whole playoff system was changed immediately after that made it incredibly difficult for BYU/non power 4 teams to contend for the national title.</p>
    
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>We deserve to be in. Our resume and the reasoning others is in points to us having the door open, not closed. Regardless if it's because of our logo or an SEC logo, we shouldn't have been left out of the discussion. In my opinion the best solution is to expand the playoffs.</p>
    <p>Why expand? We should expand to 24 teams to it's basically the AP Top 25 which will lead to less arguing to the teams towards the bottom. This also benefits to other teams who started off a little weak but hit their stride at the end of the season.</p>
