      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Brock Nebeker. I am a 23-year-old student at Brigham Young University.
        I am from Tri-Cities, Washington, and I enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing
        and hiking, as well as playing guitar, learning new skills, watching movies, and
        spending time with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I originally planned to pursue electrical engineering but became interested in
        information systems after learning more about the field. I have always been
        fascinated by technology and STEM, while also enjoying the business side of
        organizations and how systems can be made more efficient. After taking IS 201,
        I quickly realized this was the path I wanted—and needed—to pursue. I found the
        world of data especially compelling, both in how information is gathered and
        how it is analyzed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always considered myself a problem solver and a team player. I am a quick
        and eager learner who consistently works to improve as a student, employee, and
        individual. I appreciate you taking the time to read this introduction and
        consider what I bring to the table.
